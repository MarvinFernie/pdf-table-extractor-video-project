Documentation Completed and Project Ready for Video Production

This commit marks the completion of the initial documentation phase for the PDF Table Extractor Video Production project. All required documentation files have been created, structured according to specifications, and pushed to this GitHub repository.

Key accomplishments:
- Created comprehensive production package (see tested_and_completed_tasks.json)
- Defined clear tasks for video production (see not_started_tasks.json)
- Established project requirements and success criteria (see readme.md)
- Released v1.0.0 with all production assets

Next steps for the video production team:
1. Access the production package using the links in tested_and_completed_tasks.json
2. Review the script, storyboard, and UI interaction guidelines
3. Begin with the "Record Screen Captures of UI Interactions" and "Record Professional Voiceover Narration" tasks
4. Update the documentation files as you progress

When starting a task, move it from not_started_tasks.json to in_progress_tasks.json.
When completing a task, move it to tested_and_completed_tasks.json with proper test documentation.

The project is now ready for the video production phase. Good luck!
